# Project 2
Breadth-first search

# Assignment Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to get you comfortable working with graph structures and to implement a breadth-first search function to traverse the graph and find the shortest path between nodes.

# BFS Implementation
* Takes in adjlist to create the underlying graph data structure using networkx
* Iterates over neighbors using networkx API and does a breadth first search (BFS)
* Gets shortest paths from any connected nodes

# Tests
* Tests basic BFS traversal using ground truths by removing nodes that are independent to the starting node
* Tests shortest path implementation by comparing subset of the nodes' shortest path
